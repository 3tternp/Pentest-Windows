  - 
Before submitting a request, please confirm whether the tool is available；
  - Before submitting a requirement, please confirm that the tool is listed in [Tool Requirement Collection Results](https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DTHpudHlMQVVQeEFk?tab=ss_wqwwpb) Has anyone already submitted it to avoid repeated submission of requirements?；
  - Whether a tool is included depends on its ease of use and practicality；
  - The tools in the Maye toolbox require logos. If you have a better design, please upload the logo.；
  - In order to ensure the size of the virtual machine, try not to submit particularly large tools, except for very powerful ones.；
  - I am very busy at work and the version release time is not fixed. Please understand.！

**Version introduction**

    1. The latest version：v2.2 
    2. v2.2 version based on Windows11_22H2_22621.1992 Do not forget the original intention and create a simplified version of the image；
    3. Streamline the system’s built-in software, beautify terminal fonts and some icons, and moderately optimize；
    4. The mirror system hard disk is 100GB and uses a single disk file storage to improve performance; (updating, try to reduce the mirror size as much as possible)
    5. Tool icons have been rebuilt so that each tool has a corresponding icon；
    6. 2.1 Join the scoop package manager to manage most software and tools, and support scoop update + tool name for updates.；
    7. 2.2It has been solved that scoop manages script tools. Tools that support scripts can be installed and updated using scoop.；

    10. 2.2 The version adds intranet penetration tools and remote management tools, etc.
    11. Removed some tools that are no longer maintained or are basically unused；
    12. Add CMD Alias, the command line tool can directly enter the tool name + parameters in the CMD command line；
    13. Add Powershell Alias. For command line tools, just enter the tool name + parameters directly on the Powershell command line.；
    14. Added wslpp, which automatically listens to WSL ports and maps them locally. When using servers such as empire and cobaltstrike, please open wslpp first.。

**v2.2 Version changes**
