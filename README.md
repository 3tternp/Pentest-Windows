**Version introduction**

    1. The latest version：v2.2 
    2. v2.2 version based on Windows11_22H2_22621.1992 Do not forget the original intention and create a simplified version of the image；
    3. Streamline the system’s built-in software, beautify terminal fonts and some icons, and moderately optimize；
    4. The mirror system hard disk is 100GB and uses a single disk file storage to improve performance; (updating, try to reduce the mirror size as much as possible)
    5. Tool icons have been rebuilt so that each tool has a corresponding icon；
    6. 2.1 Join the scoop package manager to manage most software and tools, and support scoop update + tool name for updates.；
    7. 2.2It has been solved that scoop manages script tools. Tools that support scripts can be installed and updated using scoop.；
